# Jest and Enzyme
This assignment is all about testing React apps.  There are a lot of tools to do this.  Two of the more modern ones, and favored by many React developers are Jest and Enzyme.

## What is Jest?
Jest runs our tests.  It watches our project for any specially named files, and reads the tests that we write from them.  It then outputs the result of those tests back to us.

## What is Enzyme?
Enzyme is a set of tools to help us target specific parts of what our components render as HTML.  When you want to find the ```<h1>Hello World</h1>``` tag on the page, or an input, or a button, or anything else, Enzyme is going to make that straight forward.
